                    <p>In the midst of coronavirus, I rented a car and jumped on the road. 
                        From the American Southwest to the coast of California and back. 
                        From big cities to podunk towns. I experienced the quintessential American road trip, 
                        all while the world was in the throws of a pandemic. 
                        These are the portraits and stories of the people who I encountered along the way.

                            Similarly Lake Tahoe depends on heavy snowfall for business. This past winter had been particularly bad, low amounts of snowfall combined 
                            with COVID-19 killed tourism in the alpine town. One guy mentions “Miracle March,” which is when near the end of the busy season one last 
                            heavy snowfall occurs which gives the city fresh snow and a bump of tourism before the season's over. But this year, Miracle March did not come.</p>

                                organizations and people who own 3D printers, volunteer drivers, and healthcare facilities in need of protective gear, specifically masks. 
                                The facilities put in a request for masks, those requests get sent to owners of 3D printers to be produced, they then get picked up and 
                                packaged inside Native Hostels event space, and finally drivers deliver to the healthcare facilities.</p>

                            <br />
                            <p>A friend and local rapper in Austin. His stage name, Soupmakesitbetter. Pictured here in his studio a month after having dropped his four 
                                track Valentines Day EP titled 4 Play. COVID-19 came and shutdown Austins biggest festival, and along with it took away all the gigs and 
                                performances that musicians depend on. Soup had in-person meetings scheduled with record labels across the nation, and was supposed to 
                                headline a few of Austin’s most popular music venues in town. But all were put on hold or cancelled due to the virus. In the meantime he 
                                has been working on new tracks and finding talent to sign to his own record label, Paid Better.</p>
